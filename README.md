- 👋 Hi, I’m @lutimbastuart
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining a detailed understanding of macro-molecular interaction as a basis of their sequence, structure and function, through the application and integration of Omics and biophysical approaches.
- 🌱 My current works involve the integration of  machine learning and molecular modling for the holistic elucidation of biological molecular interacions to complement exprerimental studies towards the discovery of new therapies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Drug discovery and development pipelines through various machine learning approches and Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discover
